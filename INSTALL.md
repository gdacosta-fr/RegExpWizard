    **Installation**

In this experimental version, there is no installation procedure and no dependencies management:
1) you must ensure that Python3 is installed on your PC (should be standard under Unix-like Operating Systems),
2) you must copy all files of the project in a subdirectory on your PC.

In a shell, launch "RegExpWizard.py".

Some systems may launch it by double-clicking on it.
