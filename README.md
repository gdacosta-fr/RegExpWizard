![en](img/en.png) RegExpWizard is an **academic** project for interactively creating Regular Expressions (RE) for the [Gramps genealogy program ](https://gramps-project.org/)![](img/external.png).

RE are powerful tools for searching text, but are not intended for mere mortals.

The purpose is not implementing the full PerlRE specifications, but only a very small subset needed by genealogists.

I try to Keep It Simple (Stupid!).

This version, implemented as a Gramps 5.1 add-on,

- has no installation bundle: you must install it manually by copying files,
- has no manual, nor tutorial. Please, use tooltips.
