![en](src/img/uk.png) RegExpWizard is an **academic** project for interactively creating Regular Expressions (RE) for the [Gramps genealogy program](https://gramps-project.org/)![](src/img/external.png).

RE are powerful tools for searching text, but are not intended for mere mortals.

It is aimed at Gramps. The purpose is not implementing the full PerlRE specifications, but only a very small subset needed by genealogists.

I try to Keep It Simple (Stupid!).

This experimental version:
- needs Python 3, i.e. chances are that it will not work under Windows,
- has not installation bundle: you must install it by copying files.
