**Installation**

This is a third-party add-on; you have to install it manually.

In GitHub, click "Clone or download", then "Download ZIP".

Under Windows, in an Explorer address bar, copy/paste:

	"%appdata%\gramps\gramps51\plugins"

Under Linux, MacOS and other Unix-likes, in a file explorer, enter (possibly surrounded by double quotes):

	$HOME/.gramps/gramps51/plugins


In the "plugins" directory, delete, if any, sub-directories named "RegExpWizardXXX" (previous versions).

In both cases, unzip file "RegExpWizardXXX.zip" in this "plugins" sub-directory.

It should create a "RegExpWizardXXX" directory under "plugins".

Launch (or re-launch) Gramps.
